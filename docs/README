Record RAM usage and ab load test output


Summary

	Uses 25 MB MB of RAM.
	Uses 33 MB MB of RAM at highest load from ab.

	At 50,000 total POSTs with a concurrency of 50, I got:

		1,696	requests/second
		   29 	mean time / request (ms)

	At concurrency of 75 and 100, I got apr_socket_recv: Connection reset by peer (54).
	A 29 ms response time at 1,500 rps is plenty of juice for what I need, so I didn't
	pursue this any further.

Load test

	Start.


	Try getting server to start to time out, but could not (with ab).


	Stopped trying at 50,000 requests and 50 concurrent clients.
